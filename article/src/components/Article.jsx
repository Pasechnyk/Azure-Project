        Jorunna parva, commonly known as the sea bunny,
        is a species of dorid nudibranch, a shell-less
        marine gastropod mollusc in the family Discodorididae.
        The species was first described by Kikutaro Baba.
        Its resemblance to a rabbit facilitated a surge in
        popularity on Twitter throughout Japan in 2015.</p>

        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>The species is about 1 cm long on average.
            Its black-and-white rhinophores somewhat
            resemble a rabbit's ears. Its external gills
            are located near its rear. Its body is covered
            in papillae, fleshy protuberances used for sensory
            functions, giving it the appearance of a furry animal.
            There are multiple colorations of Jorunna parva,
            including yellow, white, and green, though the latter
            is rarely photographed. All of these variants have
            black papillae interspersed among papillae of their
            main color. There is controversy over whether or not
            the different colorations are divergent species.</p>

        <h4>Distribution</h4>
        <p>This species was described from Kii Province, Japan.
            Jorunna parva has subsequently been reported from
            the Philippines, Tanzania, Papua New Guinea, Seychelles
            and RÃ©union but there are some doubts as to whether it
            is really a species complex. The Jorunna parva are
            concentrated in areas where there is an abundance
            of food and where resources are easily acquired.
            They often cling to submerged vegetation and spend
            majority of the time at the bottom of tropical waters.</p>
